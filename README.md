### Getting started

Requirements: Node 8+, Yarn.

Clone the repo, navigate to the project in a terminal and run `yarn`.

To run both the client and server locally in development mode, run `yarn serve`.

Alternatively, the server can be run independently by first running `yarn build` and then `node server.js`. The client can then be served locally using Parcel if you wish.

### Notes

Server-side:

- Node
- socket.io

Client-side:

- React
- AntDesign
- socket.io-client
